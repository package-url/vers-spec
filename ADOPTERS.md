# Adopters

VERS (VErsion Range Specifier) has been adopted by other specifications and is supported by many tools. 
- See [Specifications](https://www.packageurl.org/#:~:text=PURL%20Adoption%20%2D%20Specifications) 
for the list of these specifications.
- See [Tools](https://www.packageurl.org/#:~:text=PURL%20v1.0-,Software%20Tools) 
for the list of these tools.

If you want to add a tool or specification that supports VERS please create an issue in the [Package-URL website repostory](https://github.com/package-url/www.packageurl.org/issues). 
There are separate issue templates for 'Add a Tool' and 'Add a Specification" because the data fields are different.

**NB** There is a "staging website" for Package-URL at: https://package-url.github.io/www.packageurl.org/ 
that will have the most recent information about specifications and tools that
 have adopted PURL. We normally update the "production" website 
 at: https://www.packageurl.org/ weekly.
